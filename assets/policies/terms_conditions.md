We may provide access to third party services and products from time to time or to our own products or Services. You acknowledge that the Website and any mobile applications are evolving and that the form and nature of the Website or mobile applications, including the Services, may change from time to time without notice to you.

# **10. RELATIONS BETWEEN EDCHECK AND USERS**

The Services are not an employment service and EdCheck does not serve as an employer of any User unless separately subject to a signed, written employment contract signed by both the User and EdCheck. Users may use EdCheck Services only to provide homework checking services to other Users or to receive homework checking services from other Users using the Services and subject to these Terms.

As such, EdCheck will not be liable for any tax or withholding, including but not limited to unemployment insurance, employer’s liability, workers’ compensation insurance, social security or payroll withholding tax in connection with your use of Services or Users’ services. You understand and agree that if EdCheck is found to be liable for any tax or withholding tax in connection with your use of Users’ services, then you will immediately reimburse and pay to EdCheck an equivalent amount, including any interest or penalties thereon.

In all cases of use of this Website, Users are acting as independent contractors and not as EdCheck’s or any other party’s employee, agent, franchisee or servant. Accordingly, you will be solely responsible for all costs incurred by you or your organization. You shall not hold yourself out as having authority to make contracts or promises on behalf of EdCheck. No User is entitled to participate in any EdCheck vacation, group medical or life insurance, disability, profit sharing or retirement benefits, or any other fringe benefits or benefit plans offered by EdCheck to its employees.

The Services provide connection to Professionals to assist with homework assignments and are engaged by EdCheck as independent contractors. As independent contractors, each Professional decides when and how often the Professional will be available to provide homework checking services to students (except that inactivity for 180 consecutive days may result in discontinuation of a Professional’s services). Each Professional controls the methods, materials, content and all aspects of the homework checking services provided. Any sample homework checking materials that may be made available to Professionals are for a Professional to review or not review and to use or not use in the Professional’s sole discretion. The Services allow Professionals to accept student homework correction assignments within certain specified time parameters (each session individually a “Correction Session”). Each Professional has the sole discretion to accept or decline or continue or discontinue a Correction Session.

# **11. ASSIGNMENT**

You may not assign or transfer these Terms in whole or in part to any third party. These Terms shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties to these Terms and their respective successors, permitted transferees, and permitted assigns.

# **12. FEEDBACK**

You acknowledge and agree that we may provide you with a mechanism to provide feedback, suggestions, and ideas, if you choose, about our Services (the "**Feedback**") and public feedback from Users with whom you have transacted.

Feedback regarding EdCheck. By submitting any Feedback you provide us a written consent to use your Feedback in improvement and promoting the Services; you agree that submitting a Feedback is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place us under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Feedback without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.

You further acknowledge that, by accepting your Feedback submission, EdCheck does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to EdCheck, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you. You agree that we may, in our sole discretion, use the Feedback you provide to us in any way, including in future enhancement and modifications to our Services. You hereby grant to us and our assigns a perpetual, worldwide, fully transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, royalty free license to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, and display the Feedback in any manner for any purpose, or without it in any media, software, or technology of any kind now existing or developed in the future, without any obligation to provide attribution or compensation to you or any third party.

Feedback Regarding Users. You acknowledge that feedback results for you may consist of comments and ratings left by other Users and that EdCheck may calculate a composite feedback number based on these individual ratings. Professinals agree to be rated by other Users along several criteria, as determined by EdCheck. EdCheck provides its automatic feedback and rating system as a means through which Users can express their opinions publicly, and EdCheck does not monitor or censor these opinions or investigate any remarks posted by Users for accuracy or reliability unless a User brings the posting to EdCheck's attention. You may be held legally responsible for damages suffered by other EdCheck Users or third parties as a result of these remarks if a court finds that these remarks are legally actionable or defamatory. EdCheck is not legally responsible for any feedback or comments posted or made available on this Website by any Users or third parties, even if that information is defamatory or otherwise legally actionable. You agree to report violations or abuses of our rating and feedback system immediately by contacting Customer Service.
